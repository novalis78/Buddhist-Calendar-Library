Buddhist Calendar Library

This C# library implements a Calendar Class for traditional Theravada Buddhist Dates based on an astronomical lunar algorithm. 

Traditionally, the Buddhist Era (BE) starts 543 BC. New year begins every Vesakh full moon. The year has 12 lunar months. Each month is divided into two fortnights (sukka- and kanhapakkhe, the light and dark week). Days are enumerated from 1 to the end of each fortnight (14/15th).

The Buddhist equivalent date for the Gregorian date:

2005 - 01 - 29 CE

will thus be

2548 - 02 - 1 - 04 BE

...meaning: in the year 2548 after the Blessed Ones Parinibbana, in the (second) lunar month, in the dark fortnight of the 4th day.

More detailed explanation of the traditional Buddhist Calendar can be found here.
